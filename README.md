# Dashboard using React and Material UI

Trying to create a web application using React and Material UI. Can be used as a starter kit for SaaS applications. This application could be described as a compilation of various features available in React, Material UI and other open source packages for charts etc. Also trying to create a documentation to help others on the usage of various features (work in progress).

Minimal design. Using the most basic and default color themes. Open source with MIT License. The third party plugins / libraries / frameworks used might have a different licensing. Please read the license section below for more details. Click here for a [demo](https://gsahadevan.github.io/react-material-ui-dashboard/).

## Installation

Assuming one has the latest NodeJs and NPM versions.

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Licenses

Credits and licenses to various third party plugins / libraries / frameworks used.

- amcharts
- apexcharts
- d3.js
- create-react-app

## Inspirations

## Why create such an application?

- Because I can, I have time to kill. COVID-19 lockdown.
- I was wondering why some companies charge hundreds of dollars for amature solutions. I am happy to provide a solution here for free.
